# Github vs Git 
## Git 
Fun fact: Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

### What Git is: 
**Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots**. Git only stores snapshots and it's a local opeartion which means that its based in the local resourses for expediency purposes.

#### Version Control 
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 
 
 ##### 3 types of version control: 
  1. Local Version Control: A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
  2. Centralized Version Control: This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. 
  3. Distributed Version Control: DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories and these backups can be easily placed on servers. 

### 3 Main States of Git 
1. Committed
Data is securely stored in a local database

2. Modified
File has been changed but not committed to the database

3. Staged
Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
