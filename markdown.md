# What I learned about Markdown:

markdown is a way to stylize text like CSS is for HTML 

You can do many things like Bold, Italic and Strikethroughs like below:
- Bold

  Add 2 "*" before and after like so: 
    **Example**
    
- Italic 
  Add 1 "*" before and after like so: 
    *Example* 
    
- Strikethrough 
  Add 2 "~~" before and after like so: 
  ~~Example~~
  

Reminder: ***It is important to remember to always close it with the same symbol  ***
