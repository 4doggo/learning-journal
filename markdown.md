# What I learned about Markdown:

## Markdown is a way to stylize text like CSS is for HTML 

You can do many things like Bold, Italic and Strikethroughs like below:

- *Bold*

  Add 2 "*" before and after like so: 
  
    ** Example **  ⇨ **Example**
    
- *Italic* 

  Add 1 "*" before and after like so: 
  
   `* Example *` ⇨ *Example*
    
- *Strikethrough* 

  Add 2 "~~" before and after like so: 
  
    ~~ Example ~~  ⇨ ~~Example~~
  

Reminder: ***It is important to remember to always close it with the same symbol and to leave no spaces before or after the word***
