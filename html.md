*Wireframes:* 
It allows you to organize the information that will need to go on each page. The use of headings and subheadings in any document might start with a large heading. 

*Tags:*
Each element has an opening tag `<content>` and a closing tag `</content>` 
Tags act like containers and they need to be opened and closed most of the time. 

#### Examples:
`<body>`
This is where majority of the stuff is written in

`<head>` 
Before the `<body>` element will often see a `<head>` element

`<title>` 
The content's title seld explanatory 

`<header>`
The main header that appears at the top of the every page and site

`<footer>`
The header that shows up at the very bottom every page and site

`<nav>` 
This element is used to contain the major navigational blocks 

`<article>`
It acts as a container for any section. It can also be nested inside each other

`<aside>` 
Basically if its used inside an `<article>` then it should contain info thats related to the article. When its used outside of an `<article>` then it acts as a container that is related to the entire page

etc.


### **Tips on creating a site:**

Its important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return
