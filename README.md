My definition of growth mindset:
> Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows you to trust yourself to tackle through difficult situations that you may think you are not ready/incapable of yet by thinking that you can actually do it because you learn and grow as you go.

3 Reminders to stay in growth mindset: 
1. *Don't over think it when you can't do it immediately (Remember that it may take time)* 
2. *Always remember that you CAN do it* :+1: 
3. *Relax and step away when frustrated with something*
