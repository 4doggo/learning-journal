definition of growth mindset:
> Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows you to trust yourself to tackle through difficult situations that you may think that are not prepared yet but you can overcome by implementing this particular mindset. 

3 Reminders to stay in growth mindset: 
- *Don't over think it when you can't do it immediately (Remember that it may take time)* 
- *Always remember that you CAN do it* :+1: 
- *Relax and step away when frustrated with something*
