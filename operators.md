### Operators

### Comparison operators evaluating conditions:
The results will be boolean (true or false)
1. `==` : is equal to 
2. `===` : strict equal to 
3. `!=` : is not equal to 
4. `!==` : strict not equal to 
5. `>` : greater than 
6. `>=` : greater than or equal to 
7. ` <` : less than 
8. ` <=` : less than or equal to 

### Logical operators:
It allows you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator
1. `&&` : logical and 
2. `||` : logical or
3. `!` : logical not

### Loops:
Loops check condition
1. `for` : used to run a code *specific* amount of times. The condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run
2. `while` : used when you dont know how many times the code should run. It can be something other than a counter
3. `do while` : It will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition evaluates to false
